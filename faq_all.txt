**Question:** HOW CAN I CANCEL MY ORDER?

**Answer:** You can cancel your order from [MY_ORDERS] until it is processed (usually within 1 hour of confirmation).
        
If it’s already packed or shipped, cancellation won’t be possible. In that case, you can refuse the delivery when it arrives. For prepaid orders, we’ll initiate your refund right after refusal.
